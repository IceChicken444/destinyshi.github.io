<h4 id="husky">Husky</h4>

<p>Husky /ˈhʌski/ is a general name for a sled-type of dog used in northern regions, differentiated from other sled-dog types by their fast pulling style. They are an ever-changing cross-breed of the fastest dogs.[1] The Alaskan Malamute, by contrast, is "the largest and most powerful" sled dog,[2] and was used for heavier loads. Huskies are used in sled dog racing. In recent years, companies have been marketing tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions as well.[3] Huskies are also today kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure trekking dogs.[4]</p>

<h4 id="german">German Sheperd </h4>

<p>The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: [ˈʃɛːfɐˌhʊnt]) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language (sometimes abbreviated as GSD). The breed is also known as the Alsatian in Britain and Ireland.[5] The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting.[6] The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club[7] and fourth-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.[8]</p>

<h4 id="doberman">Doberman</h4>

<p>The Doberman Pinscher (German pronunciation: [ˈdoːbɐman ˈpɪnʃɐ]), or Dobermann, or Doberman, is a medium-large breed of domestic dog originally developed around 1890 by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, a tax collector from Germany.[2] The Doberman has a long muzzle and stands on its toes (not the pads) and is not usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful gait. Traditionally, the ears are cropped and posted, and the tail is docked. However, in some countries it is illegal to do so. Dobermans have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail.</p>
